*Question 1*  

 
From: marissa@startup.com  
Subject:  Bad design  

Hello,  
  
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.  
   
Thanks,  
Marissa

Good Afternoon Marissa,

I appreciate your candid feedback regarding the dashboard user experience. Fortunately, I have a solution that I am confident will work for you. 

The Algolia API provides everything you will need to manage your indices programmatically, including clearing and deleting them. I would be happy to send you some examples of the API in action if that would be helpful.

Listed below is a link to the Algolia documentation regarding the management of your indices:

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns!

Kind Regards,

*Question 2*:   
  
From: carrie@coffee.com  
Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".  
  
Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?  
  
Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.

Hi Carrie,

Thanks for getting in touch with me in regards to your application issues. I would be glad to shed some light on what may be the issue here, as well as suggest a possible fix.

Based on the alert box your users have recieved, it looks like your users are attempting to upload a record that is too big for your current plan. 

You mentioned that a lot of metadata is added to each record that is not pertinent to your search functionality. If it is possible to remove or reduce the amount of this metadata from your search, your users should have more success in uploading these records. 

Listed below is a link to a helpful article that goes into more detail regarding size limitations for records and indices:
https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406981897617-Is-there-a-size-limit-for-my-index-records-

If reducing the size of your metadata is not feasible at the current time, I would be glad to work together to find a solution that will work for you.

Please let me know if you have any further quetions or concerns.

Best,  
Ethan

Good Morning Mark,

Thanks for reaching out in regards to your application issues. According to your attached screenshot, it looks like your 'searchkit' variable is undefined.

My first thought regarding this error is to check and make sure all of your environment variables are making it from your '.env' file into your application after the build process. However, I may need some more information to be able to assist you further.

I would be happy to get on a call with you shortly to go through this error with you and find a solution if that would be helpful.

Please let me know if you would like to schedule a call today, or if you have any further questions or concerns.

Kindly,
Ethan
